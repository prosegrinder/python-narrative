A small Python package for splitting text into dialogue and narrative.

Installation
------------

``narrative`` is available on PyPI. Simply install it with ``pip``::

    $ pip install narrative

You can also install it from source::

    $ git clone https://github.com/prosegrinder/python-narrative.git
    Cloning into 'python-narrative'...
    ...

    $ cd python-narrative
    $ python setup.py install
    ...

Usage
-----

``narrative`` splits a piece of prose into narrative and dialogue components. The main function ``split()`` will return a dict containing both ``narrative`` and ``dialogue`` components::

    >>> import narrative
    >>> text = '"Hello," he said. "How are you today?"'
    >>> narrative.split(text)
    {'dialogue': ['"Hello,"', '"How are you today?"'], 'narrative': ['', ' he said. ', '']}

There are two other helper functions as well.

``get_dialogue()`` returns only the dialogue components::

    >>> narrative.get_dialogue(text)
    ['"Hello,"', '"How are you today?"']

``get_narrative()`` returns a dict containing all first, second, and third person pov words::

    >>> narrative.get_dialogue(text)
    ['', ' he said. ', '']

Note: The empty strings are a feature of Python's ``split()`` function. See `Why are empty strings returned in split() results?`_ for an explanation.
